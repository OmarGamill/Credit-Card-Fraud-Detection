# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent or not using various machine learning algorithms. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation.

## Project Structure
The project is structured into four main components:

1. **Proof of Concept**: An initial demonstration of the project's feasibility.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analysis and visualization of the dataset to understand its structure and key features.
3. **Data Preprocessing (utils.py)**: Scripts for cleaning, transforming, and preparing the data for model training.
4. **Model Training (train.py)**: Training four different classifiers:
   - Logistic Regression
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   - Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
   - Decision Tree Classifier

5. **Model Evaluation (eval.py)**: Evaluation of the performance of the trained models.
6. **Main Script (main.py)**: The project's starting point, which ties together all components.
